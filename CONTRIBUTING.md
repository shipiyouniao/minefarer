# Contributing to Minefarer

Thanks for helping improve this small game and its TypeScript 7 experiment. Bug reports, accessibility improvements, translations, clearer explanations, and reproducible compiler measurements are welcome.

Read the [architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) before changing application behavior. For a large feature or toolchain change, open an issue first to explain the problem and proposed scope.

## Report a bug or suggest an improvement

Search [existing issues](https://github.com/shipiyouniao/minefarer/issues) before opening a new one. Include steps to reproduce, expected and actual behavior, and your browser or Node.js version. For a game bug, include the difficulty and whether you restored a saved game. Screenshots help with visual and accessibility issues.

Use the [security policy](SECURITY.md) for suspected vulnerabilities. Do not publish exploit details, credentials, or private browser data in a public issue.

## Set up a development environment

Use Node.js 22.12 or later in the 22.x series, or Node.js 24 or later, with npm.

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a focused branch from the latest `develop`.
3. Install the locked dependencies and start the native compiler and development server:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [the local game](http://127.0.0.1:5173/minefarer/). The default compiler is the pinned TypeScript 7 native compiler. Do not replace it with a global `tsc` or rely on the legacy alias's executable.

## Keep the architecture readable

- Keep game rules and derived presentation in pure functions. Pass randomness, time, storage, and browser effects through their owning services and adapters.
- Use objects to own session state, clocks, DOM elements, and listener lifetimes. Release timers and listeners when an object is disposed.
- Declare named interfaces and type aliases in module-scoped `src/types/*.d.ts` files and consume them with `import type`.
- Use concrete object models and small unions. Use a discriminated union when a command kind determines its payload. Application code should not introduce `any`, `unknown`, mapped types, or conditional types.
- When changing expedition replay behavior, bump `EXPEDITION_RULES_REVISION` and follow the [save policy](docs/save-policy.md). Retire old runs at the persistence boundary; remove obsolete game-rule branches. Preserve camp progress and checkpoint extraction in the same write.
- Parse stored JSON and browser input at their boundaries. Construct validated domain values; do not cast arbitrary input to a domain interface.
- Give named functions, methods, and lifecycle callbacks a documentation comment explaining their purpose. Add internal comments for decisions and invariants, and blank lines between validation, calculation, effects, and return values.
- Keep the interface minimal and keyboard accessible. Preserve covered-cell privacy in both visible markup and accessibility labels. Update all three translations when changing message contracts.
- Keep task steps, chapter progress and unlock outcomes in the task journal. Maps show places and routes; camp navigation names its destinations. Avoid persistent summaries that repeat journal entries. Show instructions beside the affected control when an action needs explanation, and keep detailed rules in the existing illustrated help or contextual tutorial.

Text files use LF on every platform through `.gitattributes`. Run `npm run format` to apply the pinned formatter. Keep unrelated formatting, dependency updates, and generated files out of your change. The intentionally complex synthetic compiler workloads live separately from application code.

## Validate a change

The standard CI checks are:

```sh
npm ci
npm audit
npm run check
node scripts/verify-build.mjs
```

These check formatting, declaration conventions, named-function documentation, inward dependency boundaries, three-language message contracts, strict types, behavioral tests, the native production build, Pages paths, and the emitted declaration graph. Add or adjust a regression test when changing behavior; documentation and artwork changes generally do not need new behavior tests.

For UI changes, also try the affected interaction in a browser, including keyboard controls and a narrow viewport when relevant. For persistence changes, check both restored progress and unavailable storage.

For compiler, type-contract, or build-pipeline changes, check the legacy route too:

```sh
npm run test:legacy
npm run build:legacy
npm run build:native
```

For performance claims, follow [the A/B measurement method](docs/build-ab.md): run `npm run bench:build -- --runs 6` on a clean, identified commit with development watchers stopped. Include raw samples, environment and tool versions, the build-input fingerprint, and limitations. Keep historical reports tied to their measured commits; do not relabel old measurements as results for new code.

## Submit a pull request

Open feature and fix pull requests against `develop`. Merge `develop` into `main` only for an agreed milestone release. Explain the concrete problem, resulting behavior, and checks you ran. Include before/after screenshots for visual changes and reproduction details for bug fixes. Keep one coherent change per pull request and respond to review feedback in that scope.

Do not commit `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.native/`, or generated `.bench/` trees. Selected benchmark reports belong in `docs/` with their provenance. New artwork should be stored in the repository with an accurate description of its source and any generation prompt in [artwork notes](docs/artwork.md).

Pull requests run validation without deploying. Pushes to `develop` or `main` validate and assemble both Pages sites: [`main` serves the stable game](https://shipiyouniao.github.io/minefarer/) and [`develop` serves the development preview](https://shipiyouniao.github.io/minefarer/dev/). A development merge updates the preview while rebuilding the stable site from its unchanged `main` revision.
